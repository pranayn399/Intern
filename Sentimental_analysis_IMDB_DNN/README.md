# Sentimental_analysis_IMDB_DNN

This project uses TFLearn to train a Sentiment Analyzer on a set of IMDB Movie ratings.
Once trained, given some input text, it will be able to classify it as either positive or negative.
The neural network that is built for this is a recurrent network.
It uses a technique called LSTM with a fully connected layer and softmax function as activation function.
